                <p>Jijabai was Shahjiraje’s wife and Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s mother, she was the queen and Rajmata too. She moulded him into an ideal ruler by sowing seeds of devotion to the nation and Dharma. She was not only a mother to Shivaji, but also a source of inspiration. She had a strong faith that she was blessed by Goddess Bhavani and Mahadev. She strongly believed that our efforts bring success to our doorstep only with the grace of God. Entire Hindu community is grateful to God for having set an example before us in the form of Rajmata Jijabai.
                    Jijabai was a very pious and intelligent woman with a great vision for an independent kingdom. Shivaji grew up and began his fight for freedom. At the young age of sixteen, he captured the fort of Thorangadh. Shivaji would not take any important decision without consulting his mother. Jijabai is widely credited with raising Shivaji in a manner that led to his future greatness.
